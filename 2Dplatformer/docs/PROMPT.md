Most players prefer to play more "full" maps, so don't make your map look too empty

If your game need an end point:
    - Unless specified, the endpoint doesn't have to be on the right side of the map, you can choose any point as the endpoint
    - But the premise is that players need some twists and turns to reach the endpoint

If your game need enemies and challenges:
    Players need to avoid traps, kill enemies, and collect target objects to reach the endpoint during the process of reaching the endpoint, this is the fun of players playing games

You can design some more complex maps, which are very attractive to players

You must use the `tilemap_overlap_modify` tool to check whether `objects` in the map overlap with terrain.
